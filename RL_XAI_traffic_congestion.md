## ðŸ“„ Abstract Summary
- Introduces a **novel approach** to traffic congestion detection in Smart Cities.  
- Combines **Reinforcement Learning (RL)** for **real-time adaptability** with **Explainable AI (XAI)** for **transparent and interpretable decision-making**.  
- Key contributions:  
  - **Reduced missing data rate** in traffic prediction.  
  - **Improved prediction accuracy** (reported at **98.10%**).  
  - Ensures **data security and privacy** in transmission between IoT devices and cloud servers.  
  - Provides **interpretable results** that build trust for real-world deployment.  
<!-- - Demonstrates ~**5% improvement** in security, reliability, and accuracy compared to existing approaches.  -->
- Proposed RL-XAI framework shows potential for more **intelligent and efficient traffic management systems**.
